**Code Crusader on a Quest for Beautiful Websites!**

While I wield Python to unlock the secrets of cool games (think code detective!), my ultimate goal is to craft stunning and interactive websites.  To achieve this, I'm actively learning the art of front-end development, with a future vision of becoming a full-stack developer.  Beyond code, I'm also exploring the world of UI/UX design, allowing me to approach web development from a user-centric perspective.  This multi-faceted journey keeps me constantly learning and pushing boundaries.

# Code & Create
Hackathons and game jams fuel my passion! Whether it's crafting code or designing experiences, these events are my playgrounds for innovation.  They allow me to network with like-minded creators, travel to new places, and meet inspiring individuals. Each jam opens doors to new opportunities and challenges, keeping my skills sharp and my creativity flowing.
